# Profiles

Your Wizard profile has three parts, and each one is Private, Friends or Everyone:

- **Build**: your version of Wizard, with every change of your own. Friends can **try it on**: it runs beside your own Wizard with your chats and apps, and Stop ends it. Your Wizard is never changed.
- **Look**: your skin and your own touches to it. Friends can **wear it**; one tap puts yours back.
- **Apps**: the App Store apps you have, and which ones you use a lot. Apps you build yourself never show; putting an app in the App Store is what makes it public.

Nothing is shared until you tap Publish, and others only ever see that frozen copy.

Your profile's ID is a Nostr ID (npub) that your Wizard makes for itself. To add a friend, paste their Nostr ID; they add yours. Nobody ever connects to your Wizard: what you share goes out through public Nostr relays, each friend's copy encrypted to that friend alone, and friend requests are sealed so relays can't see who added whom. There is no Publish step: Profiles shares again by itself whenever your look, build, apps or settings change.
